This is a port of [PeakEater](https://github.com/vvvar/PeakEater) to [aap-juce](https://github.com/atsushieno/aap-juce).

I created it to demonstrate how I manage to port a JUCE plugin to AAP ecosystem. I have uploaded the screen recording [on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_x2N_AxZOPyuhiGQ7M9KXVCo5DumTVCl/view?usp=share_link) - caution: awful quality, unchecked raw video material.
